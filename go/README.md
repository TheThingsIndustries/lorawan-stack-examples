# Go Code Examples

[Go](https://golang.org) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

## Setup

[Download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install Go. Run `go version` and make sure your version is newer than **1.15**.

We will use the gRPC API of {{% tts %}}. An API key is required in order to execute the examples, replace in the example code accordingly.

## Build

Each example can be found in a separate directory. To run each example:

```bash
$ go build $EXAMPLE/main.go
$ ./main --help
```
