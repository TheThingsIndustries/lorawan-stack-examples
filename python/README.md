# Python Code Examples

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a powerful scripting language that runs everywhere and is very ease to learn and use.

## Setup

[Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python 3. Instructions may vary depending on your Operating System, and are out of scope for this document.

We will use the HTTP API of {{% tts %}}. An API key is required in order to execute the examples, replace in the example code accordingly.

## Requirements

The examples shown in this repository work with Python 3. We only use modules from the standard library, with the exception of the popular [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/index.html) library for the HTTP requests.

## Example run

```bash
$ ./get_device.py my-application my-device [--api-key $API_KEY] [--api-url $API_URL]
```
